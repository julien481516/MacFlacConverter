# 🎵 FLAC to WAV Converter 🎵

**FLAC to WAV Converter** is a macOS application that allows users to convert FLAC audio files into WAV format with ease. This project is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for future expansion to support additional audio formats.

## Why Preserve Lossless Files?

Preserving lossless files is crucial for maintaining the highest quality audio experience. Unlike compressed formats, lossless files like FLAC retain every detail of the original recording, ensuring that you hear the music exactly as the artist intended. This is particularly important for audiophiles and music enthusiasts who value clarity, depth, and authenticity in their listening experience. 🎶✨
